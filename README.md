# Spatial Streaming

A two hour workshop. You describe a thing, it becomes a 3D model, you upload it
to Miris, and it streams onto a pedestal in a page you publish and share.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then follow the guide on the right. It writes most of the code for you, and
explains what it wrote.

You need a fal.ai key in `.env.local` before step 1.2:

```
FAL_KEY=your-key-here
```

Restart the dev server after creating that file. Environment variables are only
read at boot.

## What costs money

The image is fractions of a cent. The 3D model is about $1.40 and takes four to
five minutes, on your own fal key. Rerolling the image is cheap, so get the
image right before you submit it for 3D.

## For presenters

### Tracks

Three: Summon (creatures), Atelier (crafted goods), Reliquary (museum holdings).

The choice is a **gate, not a setting**. `miris/Start.tsx` takes the whole
viewport before anything else runs, and until a track is picked the sidebar does
not render and the Miris engine does not boot. That last part matters: booting
costs six to nine seconds on a cold JWKS, and there is no reason to spend it
behind a screen nobody has acted on yet.

The choice is stored as `track` in `data.json` and drives four things: the
accent, the prompt placeholder, the style phrase the route prepends before the
prompt reaches fal, and what the curator writes.

Adding a fourth is one entry in `miris/tracks.ts`.

### Visual design

Built on the Miris kit rather than an invented palette: Geist and Geist Mono,
and the mono ramp from `tokens.css`. Each track takes a ramp from its own world:
Summon `analog-500 #FF3500` (ember), Atelier `monitor-500 #FF9500` (brass and
walnut), Reliquary `scanner-500 #00D5FF` (vitrine glass). The accent is a single
CSS variable, so a track change recolours the gate, the sidebar and the
generator overlay together.

Atelier started as `mono-200` bone, on the reasoning that materials should carry
that track rather than colour. It was the better idea and the worse interface:
bone as an accent is indistinguishable from body text, so the "you make a piece"
line and every button read as unstyled. Legibility won.

The gate is three full-bleed columns, not cards in a list. The whole column is
the control, content is vertically centred, and each column carries a rail that
is a hairline at rest and resolves into four filling blocks on hover or focus.
That is the same level-of-detail language the step rail uses, at hero scale, and
it is the one place the design spends any boldness.

Mono carries the utility layer (step ids, meters, timings, code), Geist carries
prose. The step rail is a four-block level-of-detail meter: one block ahead,
partially filled at the current step, four when done. The chrome renders
progressive detail because that is what the workshop is about.

The four minute wait shows a stage list and an elapsed clock rather than a
spinner, because a spinner tells you nothing across minutes.

### The shape of it

- `app/stage.tsx` is the attendee's file. It ships with marker comments and the
  sidebar writes between them.
- `miris/devApi.ts` is the only server code: it writes files, proxies
  fal, and owns `data.json`. The fal key never reaches the browser.
- `miris/` holds the guide, the curriculum copy, the snippets, the store and the
  config.

### Removing the guide

Comment out `<MirisGuide />` in `app/main.tsx`. That is step 5.2, and it is
the only line the guide adds to the app. Verified: the production build is clean
with it commented out.

`miris/` itself is **not** deletable. `stage.tsx` imports `miris/config` and
`miris/Card`, and the route handler imports `markers`, `store`, `snippets` and
`config`. Removing the folder fails the build with six unresolved imports. The
guide *component* is what comes out in one line, not the folder.

### The SDK pin is not negotiable

```
@miris-inc/core   0.0.8-1238406
@miris-inc/three  0.0.8-1238406
```

Earlier builds fail under Next entirely, in both bundlers, with
`TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL`. The engine resolves its
WASM loader from `import.meta.url`, and Next never gives a bundled module a real
HTTP one: webpack's is literally `webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/...`.
This build makes the loader bundler-analyzable instead, and the WASM arrives as
`/_next/static/media/AquaApi.<hash>.wasm`.

`three` is pinned to `0.185.0`, the version the SDK was built against. The SDK
also bundles its own copy, so the console warns about multiple instances. That
is expected.

### Placement numbers are measured, and version-specific

`FIT_OVERRIDES` in `miris/config.ts` carries a scale and a floor per asset. Both
were measured on screen against `0.0.8-1238406` on 2026-08-28.

They are needed because the SDK's reported bounds are the octree cell holding
the asset, not the asset. For the demo asset it reads as a uniform 11.59 cube
whatever is inside it, so a box-derived scale always renders content small, and
the box floor is nowhere near where the content starts. Measured content floor
is -1.017 here; on `0.0.8-dc2d7ec` the same asset measured -1.24.

**If the SDK pin changes, re-measure.** Step 3.2 turns this into a lesson rather
than hiding it: attendees nudge two numbers and watch their asset sit down.

### Renderer settings that are not style choices

`alpha: true`, `antialias: false`, `linear` output, ACES tone mapping. This is
the pairing the SDK's own `<miris-scene>` ships. Changing any of them shifts or
breaks the splat composite. Linear output darkens everything non-splat, which is
why the HDR sits at 1.6 intensity instead of the 0.62 a normal scene wants.

`dpr` is capped at 1.5 and `powerPreference` is `high-performance`: splats are
fill-rate bound.

`devIndicators` is off. The SDK logs engine-level console errors attendees
cannot act on, and Next's dev overlay covers the entire stage when it sees them.

The engine is booted once per page load at module scope and never disposed. That
is deliberate: every Fill rewrites `stage.tsx`, so Fast Refresh remounts the
stage, and constructing a scene per mount leaked engine-registered scenes that
kept streaming. Disposing them in effect cleanup is worse, because it runs while
the scene still has children and fails three engine assertions.

### The API is development-only

`/api/miris` exists only as Vite dev middleware, so a production build has no
such endpoint at all, and
returns 403. Attendees publish this app and share the link at step 5.3, and
commenting out the guide does not remove the route: without the gate, anyone
with the link could spend their fal key or rewrite files. Verified against a
production build.

### Known risks

**Miris endpoint latency is the biggest one.** Measured 2026-08-28:
`app.miris.com/.well-known/jwks.json` cold-starts at 6 to 9 seconds, then
serves in 0.3s once warm, and the engine's own fetch gives up during a cold
start. `content.app.miris.com` served a 42KB thumbnail in 13.2 seconds during
the same window, and streaming failed in two independent harnesses at once.
Forty people starting simultaneously on conference wifi is exactly this
condition. Rehearse it under load.

**Per-attendee Miris signup is untested at scale.** Signup, upload, processing,
then finding a viewer key in a console none of them have seen. It is scheduled
inside the four minute model wait, which is the only reason it fits.

**Everything after step 4 depends on their upload having processed.** Anyone
whose upload stalls can still finish on the demo asset by leaving the uuid field
empty.

### Testing

Browser verification lives outside this repo so a fork carries no Playwright:
see `verify-stage.mjs` and `measure-seat.mjs` in the sibling `miris-atelier`
checkout.
